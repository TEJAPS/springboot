Lambda expressions: write code in functional style.
	concise way to implement SAM(single abstract method) interface using expression.
	used to iterate, filter and extract data.
	implement interface which has functional interface.
	we dont define methods, we just write implementation code.
	lambda expression is treater as function hence no .class file is created.
	WHY? - less code.
	SYNTAX - (argument-list) -> {body}
	if paranthesis then return keyword is required, else not.
	
Method references: used to refer method of functional interface. Easy form of lambda expression. replace lambda expression with this.
	types: ref to static method, to instance method, to constructor
	
Functional interfaces: Interface which has only one abstrace method, using optional annotation @FunctionalInterface
	can have any number of default, static methods but contains only one abstract method.
	can declare methods of object class.
	It can contain any number of Object class methods.  
	Can extends another interface only when it does not have any abstract method.
			======================IMPLEMENTATION DONE TILL HERE SO FAR======================
Stream API: util package, consist of classes/interface/enum allowing functionaly style operations on elements.
	does not store elements. simple conveys from source through pipeline of computational operations.
	functional in nature meaning it does not modify source.
	it is lazy and evaluates code only when required.
	each element is visited only once during life of stream.

--------------------------------------------
dependency scope:
> compile - avail @ compile time and run time.
> provided - avail @ compile time. Dependencies that are expected to be provided by runtime env, like tomcat. available at compile time but are not packaged with app jar. ex: servlet -api
> runtime - avail @ only runtime. ex: hibernate core.
> system - same as provided but exact path needs to be provided - tightly coupled with system configuration
> import - used in dependencyManagement to control scope of dependencies brought in by transitive dependencies
> test -
